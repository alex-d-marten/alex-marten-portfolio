                            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                            <p>
                                My name is Alex Marten and I am beginning my journey into Software, this is my portfolio to highlight some of my work and to introduce myself. 
                                I began my journey as and undergrad at UC Davis where I studied chemical engineering. After I graduated from UC Davis I started work as an Automation Engineer for a bay area company called Zymergen.
                                Through my time at Zymergen I was exposed to so many different I was introduced to so many cool technolgies and robots which I had never interacted with before.
                                However, none compared to how astonished I was with the world of software. In this role I was primarily exposed to JavaScript, C# and Python.
                                I also got to dabble in the world of Mechatronics where I was more focused on the actual hardware itself and through these experiences I knew that I wanted to go into software.
                                Due to my lack of education in the subject I decided to enroll in the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp to jump start my career where I am learning the basics of web development.

                            <h3>My Favorite Hobbies</h3>
                            <p>
                                I have a handful of hobbies that I enjoy every week. I love to go on hikes all around the Bay Area, there is so much to see in this one area and I have been inspired by some of the natural beauty of the area.
                                I also love to go to the gym to lift weights and play the occasional game of pick-up basketball. Lastly, I enjoy video games and have always dreamt that one day I could work on developing them.
                                If I am not doing any of these activities than I am usually hanging with my friends or spending time with family.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Where I'm From</h3>
                            <p>
                                I grew up in a suburb of Sacramento known as Roseville, California. My parents settled down here after immigrating from Canada and living in the midwest for a few years.
                                I then spent time in Davis for college and shortly after moved out to the Bay Area where I am currently living still.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Why I'm striving to be a software engineer</h3>
                            <p>
                                I have struggle with finding a passion that truly inspires me to love what I do every day and I have been fortunate enough to have the opportunities at my current position to test out multiple areas of technology.
                                However, what ended up sticking was software and I know that this is something I can see myself working on for my career. I think the technology has come so far and I love to interact with the software.
                                There is nothing better than writing some code, running your script and seeing the result you wanted. I want to learn more about this field so that one day I can become a fully developed software engineer.
